## Introduction

This coding standards guide aims to establish consistent practices across all projects at our company. Following these standards will improve code quality, maintainability, and collaboration between teams.

## Naming Conventions

Naming conventions ensure code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across the organization.

### Guidelines

- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Follow language-specific casing conventions
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized
- Choose clarity over brevity

### Examples

#### Poor Naming:
```csharp
var x = GetData(); // What is x? What data?
int d = 7; // What does d represent?
void Process() {} // Process what, and how?
```

#### Good Naming:
```csharp
var customerOrders = GetCustomerOrders();
int daysInWeek = 7;
void ProcessPaymentTransaction() {}
```

For class and file names:

**Poor:** `MyClass.cs`, `Utils.cs`, `Manager.cs`  
**Good:** `CustomerRepository.cs`, `InvoiceProcessor.cs`, `PaymentValidationService.cs`

## Comments and Documentation

Comments should explain "why" something is done rather than "what" is being done, which should be obvious from good naming.

### Guidelines

- Code should be self-documenting
- Comments explain "why", not "what"
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Keep comments updated when code changes
- Use documentation generators for API documentation

### Examples

#### Poor Comments:
```javascript
// Loop through array
for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
  // Check if admin
  if (users[i].role === 'admin') {
    // Add to admins array
    admins.push(users[i]);
  }
}
```

#### Good Comments:
```javascript
// Extract admins separately for permission-based feature flags
for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
  if (users[i].role === 'admin') {
    admins.push(users[i]);
  }
}
```

#### API Documentation:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Processes a payment using the specified payment provider
/// </summary>
/// <param name="paymentDetails">The payment information including amount and method</param>
/// <param name="customerId">Unique identifier for the customer</param>
/// <returns>Transaction ID if successful</returns>
/// <exception cref="PaymentDeclinedException">Thrown when payment is declined</exception>
public string ProcessPayment(PaymentDetails paymentDetails, int customerId)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

## Error Handling

Effective error handling prevents silent failures and provides valuable debugging information.

### Guidelines

- Never silently swallow exceptions
- Log exceptions with appropriate context
- Categorize errors by type
- Consider the user experience when errors occur
- Include relevant troubleshooting information in error messages

### Examples

#### Poor Error Handling:
```csharp
try {
    ProcessFile(fileName);
}
catch (Exception) {
    // Silently swallows all errors
}
```

#### Good Error Handling:
```csharp
try {
    ProcessFile(fileName);
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
    logger.Error($"The file {fileName} was not found. Details: {ex.Message}");
    throw new BusinessException("The requested file could not be found.", ex);
}
catch (UnauthorizedAccessException ex) {
    logger.Error($"Permission denied when accessing {fileName}. Details: {ex.Message}");
    throw new BusinessException("You don't have permission to access this file.", ex);
}
catch (Exception ex) {
    logger.Error($"Unexpected error processing {fileName}. Details: {ex.Message}");
    throw; // Rethrow unexpected exceptions after logging
}
```

## Testing

Testing ensures code quality and prevents regressions when changes are made.

### Guidelines

- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Write tests that are independent and repeatable
- Target 80% code coverage minimum
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Name tests descriptively to document behavior

### Examples

#### Function to Test:
```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}
```

#### Unit Tests:
```javascript
test('calculateTotal returns correct sum for multiple items', () => {
  // Arrange
  const testItems = [
    { name: 'Pen', price: 1.50, quantity: 2 },
    { name: 'Notebook', price: 4.00, quantity: 1 }
  ];
  
  // Act
  const result = calculateTotal(testItems);
  
  // Assert
  expect(result).toBe(7.00); // 1.50*2 + 4.00*1 = 7.00
});

test('calculateTotal returns zero for empty array', () => {
  expect(calculateTotal([])).toBe(0);
});
```

## Code Review Process

Code reviews catch issues early and spread knowledge across the team.

### Guidelines

- All code changes must be reviewed before merging
- Use a standard review checklist
- Focus on code, not the author
- Provide constructive feedback with suggestions
- Address all review comments

### Review Checklist

1. Does the code meet functional requirements?
2. Does it follow our naming conventions?
3. Is there adequate test coverage?
4. Are edge cases handled?
5. Is there any duplicated code?
6. Are security best practices followed?

### Example Code Review Comment

#### Original Code:
```javascript
if (isValid == true) {
    doSomething();
}
```

#### Review Comment:
"This can be simplified to `if (isValid)` for better readability. Also, our error handling guidelines require a specific action when isValid is false."

## Version Control

Version control practices maintain code history and facilitate collaboration.

### Guidelines

- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use a consistent branching strategy
- Keep commits focused on a single concern
- Reference issue numbers in commits
- Create pull requests for code reviews

### Examples

#### Poor Commit Message:
```
"Fixed stuff"
```

#### Good Commit Message:
```
feat(payment): implement PayPal integration

- Added PayPalClient class for API communication
- Implemented payment processing workflow
- Added unit tests for success and failure scenarios

Resolves: #123
```

### Branching Strategy

```
master (production code)
  └── release/2.1 (current release)
      └── feature/paypal-integration (feature branch)
  └── hotfix/security-vulnerability (emergency fix)
```

## Implementation

To implement these standards:

1. All new projects must adopt these standards from inception
2. Existing projects should implement standards during regular maintenance
3. Configure automated tools to enforce standards where possible:
   - Linters
   - Code formatters
   - Static analysis tools
   - Git hooks
4. Include standards review in the code review process
